# The ISP scenario for which to generate ISPyPSA inputs
# Options (descriptions lifted from the 2024 ISP):
#   "Progressive Change": Reflects slower economic growth and energy investment with
#       economic and international factors placing industrial demands at greater risk and slower
#       decarbonisation action beyond current commitments
#   "Step Change": Fulfils Australiaâ€™s emission reduction commitments in a growing economy
#   "Green Energy Exports": Sees very strong industrial decarbonisation and low-emission energy exports
scenario: Step Change

    # The regional granularity of the nodes in the modelled network
    # Options:
    #   "sub_regions": ISP sub-regions are added as network nodes (12 nodes)
    #   "nem_regions": NEM regions are added as network nodes (5 nodes)
    #   "single_region": A single node, the Victorian sub-region, is added as a network node (1 node)
    #   TODO: Clarify `single_region`/`copper_plate` implementation

    # Whether Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) are modelled as distinct nodes
    # Options:
    #   "discrete_nodes": REZs are added as network nodes to model REZ transmission limits
    #   "attached_to_parent_node": REZ resources are attached to their parent node (sub-region or NEM region)
