# Introduction

ISPyPSA is a Python package for building capacity expansion and operational models for
the Australian National Electricity Market. The methodology is based on
the Australian Energy Market Operator's (AEMO) Integrated System Plan (ISP). ISPyPSA
converts AEMO's inputs and assumptions data into a format compatible with the PyPSA
software, which is then used to run optimal capacity expansion and system operation.

## Beta Release: v0.1.0-beta

!!! important

    ISPyPSA is at beta release! What does that mean?

    This version has been released primarily to support engagement and testing as the
    OpenISP team works towards a stable v1.0.0 release in 2026. For now, ISPyPSA lacks
    a few features and requires more testing before it will be ready
    for general use. However, please use, test, and explore ISPyPSA. Extensive data
    handling and model formulation functionality has already been built out and may be
    helpful to advanced users. We welcome all enquiries and feedback, please reach us at
    dylan.mcconnell@unsw.edu.au.
