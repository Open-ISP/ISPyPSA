# Introduction

ISPyPSA is a Python package for building capacity expansion and operational models for
the Australian National Electricity Market. The methodology is based on
the Australian Energy Market Operator's (AEMO) Integrated System Plan (ISP). ISPyPSA
converts AEMO's inputs and assumptions data into a format compatible with the PyPSA
software, which is then used to run optimal capacity expansion and system operation.
