Below is an example of the default ISPyPSA workflow implemented using the Python API.
This is the same workflow which the CLI follows. To use this workflow you simply need to
edit the code to point at an ispypsa_config.yaml file of your choice, then run Python
script.

```Python
--8<-- "example_workflow.py"
```
