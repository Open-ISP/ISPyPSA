# The ISP scenario for which to generate ISPyPSA inputs
# Options (descriptions lifted from the 2024 ISP):
#   "Progressive Change": Reflects slower economic growth and energy investment with
#       economic and international factors placing industrial demands at greater risk and slower
#       decarbonisation action beyond current commitments
#   "Step Change": Fulfils Australiaâ€™s emission reduction commitments in a growing economy
#   "Green Energy Exports": Sees very strong industrial decarbonisation and low-emission energy exports
scenario: Step Change
# Optional: Filter template inputs to specific NEM regions
